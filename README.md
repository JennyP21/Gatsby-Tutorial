# Gatsby Portfolio
### Project is live at: https://gatsby.jennypatel.dev/

This project uses the Gatsby framework to layout and design its frontend. I have created this project as a tutorial to learn Gatsby Framework which is an excellent framework to quickly create frontend websites.

### Key Gatsby Techniques

1. Template Rendering.
   
  This project uses templates to create some components. In my website, projects uses this so
  that it does not repeat same code for every project to make the project more efficient and
  smaller in size.

2. Plugins
   
  I have installed pluggins to render the project details from an mark down file make it more scalable.

3. GraphQL

  This project pulls project data using GraphQL queries. I have using queries at various places to load images, project details and Page Meta Data.
